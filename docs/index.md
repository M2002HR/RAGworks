# Documentation Index

Start here for the portfolio-foundation manuals:

- [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) – module overview, data flow, and design decisions.
- [DEMO.md](DEMO.md) – precise run instructions (local, Docker, CLI) for every demo.
- [README](../README.md) – project introduction, quickstart, FAQ, troubleshooting, and CI notes.

All examples rely on synthetic data. Do not paste real or sensitive information.
